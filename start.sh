Usage: bash start.sh [BACKEND-STACK]

If no flag is given, the script asks interactively (wizard).
  --dotnet   .NET/DevArchitecture full support (devarch-module + DevArch gate)
  --generic  stack-agnostic backend (NO devarch-module; sonarqube-check is language-agnostic and stays)

Every install ships the whole kit: all agents, all skills — backend, web and mobile (RN/Expo) together.
  --backend | --frontend | --mobile | --fullstack   accepted, no effect (kept so older commands still run)
