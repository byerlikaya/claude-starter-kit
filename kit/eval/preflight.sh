#
# Why this exists. The kit is written to degrade rather than break: sha256sum -> shasum -> cksum for digests,
# and so on. (It no longer needs jq or python at all — every JSON read and write is one bash/awk path on every
# OS — so neither is reported here: a row for a tool nothing uses would send people to install it.) That is the right design, and it is also
# why a missing tool never announces itself — the fallback runs, something is quietly worse, and the user finds
# out later from a symptom that points somewhere else. A Windows Git Bash install with no jq and no python is
# the normal case, not the exotic one, and it was where every surprise in this project came from.
#
# So: report, do not install. Nothing here writes to the machine or blocks a run. The user asked for exactly
# that boundary — a scaffolding tool that silently installs software on someone's workstation is a worse problem
# than the one it solves, and on a managed corporate machine it simply fails in a new way.
#
# Called from start.sh and adopt.sh (before the install summary) and from doctor.sh (so it stays re-runnable).
#   bash preflight.sh            # human-readable report, always exit 0
#   bash preflight.sh --quiet    # print only what is missing; exit 1 if any REQUIRED tool is absent
