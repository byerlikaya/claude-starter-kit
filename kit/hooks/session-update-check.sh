# SessionStart hook (startup only) — when a newer kit version is published, have Claude ASK the user whether to
# update now (Update · Later · Skip this version), and never make the session wait to find out.
#
# The gap it closes: a fix only reaches a project when somebody REMEMBERS to run /crew-update. Nothing surfaces a
# release, so shipped fixes sit unused in installs that would want them.
#
# The rule that shapes every line below: **this hook performs no network I/O in the foreground.** A SessionStart
# hook blocks the session until it returns, its timeout is 60s, and the version lookup is exactly the kind of call
# that hangs behind a corporate proxy or an offline machine. That is the same class of failure as the route-hint
# fork storm (2.0.1): the kit spending the user's session-open budget and getting blamed on the CLI. So:
#   - the foreground reads ONE cache file and exits — no curl, no npm, no subshell loop;
#   - when that cache is older than a day it starts a DETACHED refresher whose result is used by the NEXT session.
#     A version notice is not urgent; being one session late costs nothing, blocking costs everything.
#   - if the refresher is killed (session ends first) nothing is written and the next startup simply tries again.
#     The worst case is a notice that arrives late or not at all — never a hang, never a wrong version.
#
# Deliberate scope:
#   - `startup` ONLY. On resume/clear/compact this would re-announce the same thing inside one session, and the
#     session-start channel also carries the rehydrate and trust notices — training the user to skim it is a cost
#     paid by those two, not by this one.
#   - BOTH editions, each on its own channel. A project install compares `.claude/VERSION` against the npm dist-tag
#     and points at `/crew-update`; a plugin install compares its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` against the
#     marketplace repo's copy — the number that will actually reach it — and points at `claude plugin update`.
#     The plugin's cache is user-level (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME`), the one case where the kit's "everything inside the
#     repo" rule cannot apply, because a plugin install is not inside one. With both present the project install
#     wins and the plugin copy stays quiet, so one release is never announced twice.
#   - A QUESTION, never an action. Nothing in this file installs anything: no npx, no npm, no updater — the update
#     runs only when the user picks "Update", through /crew-update (or the plugin command). A silent auto-update is
#     ruled out on purpose: it rewrites the very gates the kit is made of (hooks, settings.json, the discipline), a
#     compromised package would run itself in every project, and a team sharing .claude/ would get a diff nobody
#     asked for. smoke-test.sh pins that this file runs none of those commands.
#   - Asked at most once a day per version. Asking is recorded when the question goes out, so a question the user
#     closes without answering counts as "Later". `--answer later|skip <version>` records the reply (Claude runs
#     it, the hook cannot see the answer): "skip" silences that version for good — a newer one asks again.
#   - Silent when nobody can answer: CI set, CREW_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1, or a session Claude Code marks unattended
#     (CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ATTENDED=0 — measured: `claude -p` sets 0, the terminal and desktop app set 1; the
#     variable is undocumented, so the question text also tells Claude not to ask when nobody can answer).
#   - Opt out entirely with CREW_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 — an outbound request nobody asked for is not acceptable in every
#     environment, and the answer to that is a switch, not a justification.
#
# The version string is treated as untrusted input: it comes off the network, is filtered to [0-9A-Za-z.-], and must
# look like a release before it is ever printed into the model's context.
