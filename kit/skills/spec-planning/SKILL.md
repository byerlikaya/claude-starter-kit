# Spec-First Planning

<!-- routing-eval reads the next line; why it sits in the body: AGENT_TEMPLATE.md -->
Trigger phrases: "plan", "spec", "task breakdown", "acceptance criteria", "roadmap", "how do we split this"

Before writing code: what will be done, how it counts as "done", and in what order to proceed become clear.

## Steps
1. **Purpose & scope:** the problem being solved in a single sentence; also write the out-of-scope explicitly (prevent scope creep).
2. **Split into vertical slices:** the smallest end-to-end working pieces (not horizontal layers). Each slice delivers value on its own.
3. **A contract for every task:** input · output · **measurable acceptance criterion** (testable) · estimated risk.
4. **Dependency graph:** which task waits on what; no cycles. **Bring the riskiest/most-unknown to the front** (fail-fast).
5. **Uncertainties:** assumption list + open questions; do not fill ambiguous spots with a guess, ask with explicit options.

## Output (docs/PLAN.md)
```
# <Feature> — Plan
## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] AC-1: <measurable outcome>
- [ ] AC-2: <measurable outcome>
## Tasks (order)
1. <task> — satisfies: AC-1 — dependency: <none/#n> — risk: <low/medium/high>
## Assumptions / Open questions
- ...
```

**Every criterion carries a stable id, and every task names the ids it satisfies.** The id is what makes the plan
checkable later: "AC-2 is only partly built" can be said, argued about and tracked; "the second checkbox" cannot,
and renumbering a list silently re-points every reference to it. Never reuse or renumber an id — a dropped
criterion keeps its id with a strike-through and a one-line reason. A criterion no task satisfies, and a task that
satisfies no criterion, are both findings before a line of code is written.

## Mark what you do not know — do not fill it in
Where a requirement admits more than one reading, write the marker **`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <the question>]`** at
that exact spot in the plan. Do not resolve it with the likeliest interpretation and move on.

This is the difference between a discipline and a hope. "Stop and ask when unsure" (§1) depends on noticing the
uncertainty in the moment; a marker survives into the artifact, where the user, a reviewer and a later session
can all see it. A plausible assumption silently written into a spec is indistinguishable from a decision, and
that is exactly how the wrong feature gets built correctly.

Rules that keep it honest:
- The marker carries the **question**, not the label. `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: does an expired invite count as
  used, or can it be re-sent?]` is actionable; `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: invites]` is noise.
- A plan may ship with markers — that is the point. It may **not** ship with a marker inside an acceptance
  criterion: a criterion nobody can evaluate is not a criterion.
- Resolve by asking, never by choosing. When the user answers, replace the marker with the answer *and* record
  which reading was rejected — the alternative is what a future reader needs.
- Zero markers on a genuinely ambiguous brief is a smell, not a win.

## Converge — before the work is called done, hold the code up against the plan

Tests prove the code does what the tests say. Nothing so far proves it does what the PLAN said: a criterion can be
quietly half-built with every test green, and code nobody asked for can ride along unremarked. So when a plan
exists, closing the work includes one pass that reads each criterion against the code as it now stands.

Bound the pass to what the plan names — the criteria, the tasks, and the files and components they point at. Do not
widen the audit into the rest of the codebase. For each `AC-n`, look at the code in that scope and record a finding
**only where there is a gap**, classified as exactly one of:

| Gap | Means |
|---|---|
| **missing** | nothing in the code implements the criterion |
| **partial** | something does, but not all of what the criterion states |
| **contradicts** | the code does something that conflicts with the criterion or a plan decision |
| **unrequested** | the code contains work no criterion or task called for |

`unrequested` is the one that is easy to skip and should not be: it is scope creep made visible (principle 3,
"surgical change"). It is surfaced, never deleted by this pass — the user decides whether it stays, and if it
does, it gets a criterion.

Report it as a table — `AC-n | gap | evidence (file/area) | remaining work` — then either:
- **Converged:** zero findings. Say so in one line, with how many criteria were checked.
- **Not converged:** append each remaining item to the plan as a task that names its `AC-n`, and go back to
  producing. Repeat the pass after that work, until it converges or the user accepts a named gap explicitly.

This is model discipline, not a gate: no exit code can judge "partially built". What makes it hold is the table —
a pass that produced no table did not run.

## DoD (this skill's contribution)
- Every task's "done" is testable; ordering and dependencies are visible; the riskiest work has been brought to the front.
- Every unresolved ambiguity carries a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker; no acceptance criterion contains one.
- Every criterion has a stable `AC-n` id and at least one task that satisfies it; at close, a converge pass
  has run and either reported **Converged** or left its remaining items in the plan as tasks.
