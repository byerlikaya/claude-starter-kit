  Retrospective self-audit after nontrivial work: unverified assumptions, skipped items, is-this-the-right-
  approach — findings, not code. The step-back counterpart to iterate's refine-to-done loop.

# Reflect — step back and audit the work, not just the code

<!-- routing-eval reads this line; it lives in the BODY so the always-on skill LISTING stays inside
     Claude Code's budget (1% of the context window) — an overflowing listing gets descriptions
     truncated or dropped, which strips the very keywords a match depends on. -->
Trigger phrases: "reflect", "retro", "retrospective", "what did we miss", "step back", "introspect"

## When
A nontrivial chunk of work just finished (a feature, a plan, a debugging session) and it's worth a deliberate
step back **before** committing or moving on. This is the meta-cognitive counterpart to [[iterate]]: iterate
drives a change *to* its exit test; reflect asks whether the exit test — and the approach behind it — was even
the right one. Skip it for a one-line, unambiguous change; there's nothing to reflect on.

## Measure first, then remember
Run **`bash .claude/hooks/session-stats.sh`** before answering anything below, and open the pass with what it
reports. A retro built only on recall is an interview with the least reliable witness in the room: the model
reconstructs a tidy story from a context that has already been summarised, and the stretches where it span on a
failing approach are exactly the ones it remembers least. The script counts what actually happened — prompts,
tool calls, failing loops, near-duplicate prompts, interrupts, auto-compactions.

Treat each ⚠️ as a **question to answer in the pass**, not a verdict: a runaway loop asks *what assumption kept
failing*; a repeated prompt asks *what context never landed*; an interrupt asks *where intent diverged*; an auto
compaction asks *what state was silently dropped*. If the numbers and your recollection disagree, the numbers are
the record. If the script is missing (a plugin install has no `.claude/hooks/`), say the retro is recall-based —
do not present recall as measurement.

## The pass
Ask each question honestly and write the answer, not a reassurance:
1. **Unverified assumptions** — what did I take for granted that I never checked? Name each one and whether it
   was actually confirmed (read the code / ran the flow) or just assumed.
2. **What got skipped** — an edge case, an error path, a test, a doc update, a security/privacy angle. What was
   silently dropped, and was that a conscious trade-off or an oversight?
3. **Right approach?** — with hindsight, is this the direction we'd still pick? Did scope creep in? Is there a
   simpler path we walked past ([[code-review]] altitude: could 200 lines be 50)?
4. **Evidence gap** — which claims of "done" / "works" rest on having *observed* behavior vs. on inference?
   An unobserved "it works" is a finding (see [[iterate]] / verify: drive the real flow).
5. **What I'd tell the next session** — the one thing a fresh context most needs to know (feeds [[handoff]]).

## Guardrails
- **Findings, not code.** Reflect surfaces gaps; the relevant specialist fixes them (a found gap re-enters
  [[iterate]] or the author agent). It changes nothing itself.
- **Honest, not performative.** A retro that only confirms good work is a failed retro. If nothing is found,
  say specifically *why* you're confident (what was verified), don't just assert it.
- **Bounded.** One pass, concrete findings, then act or close — not an open rumination loop.
- **Token discipline** ([[token-budget]]): a short ranked findings list to the main thread; detail to a file.

## DoD (this skill's contribution)
- `session-stats.sh` was run and every ⚠️ it raised is answered — or its absence is stated.
- Assumptions are labeled verified vs. assumed; unverified ones are flagged, not buried.
- Skipped items and any scope creep are named explicitly.
- Every "done/works" claim is traced to observed evidence or marked as inference.
- Findings are actionable (each maps to a fix, a follow-up, or an accepted trade-off).
