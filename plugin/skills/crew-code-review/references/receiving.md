# Receiving a review — an inbound comment is a candidate, not an instruction

Read this on the skill's other mode: the review is someone else's and the code is yours — a teammate's comments, a
quality gate's report, a bot's PR review.

**Read every item before changing any line.** Comments are written one per symptom, and two of them
often share one cause; applying them in arrival order yields a patch per symptom instead of one fix at the cause.
Group by cause, then decide.

Each item then earns the same disprove pass as a finding of your own. Any "no" below is a reason to answer in the
thread, not to edit:
1. **Defect or preference?** Give each comment a severity and a category from SKILL.md — inbound prose arrives
   unranked, you rank it, and only a `critical` or `high` blocks.
2. **Does it hold where the reviewer did not look?** Check the call sites and callers the comment never opened.
3. **Does it contradict a decision already recorded?** An `adr` or a documented constraint outranks the comment —
   reopen the decision, do not quietly edit around it.
4. **Does the real check still pass with it applied?** Run it, don't re-read it. A suggestion that turns a check
   red is reported back, and never satisfied by weakening the check (Verifier integrity, in SKILL.md).
5. **Is it against the current revision?** A comment on an older one may already be answered by a later commit.

Every inbound item leaves with a disposition from SKILL.md's triage table; none is left merely read. **A reasoned
refusal is an answer** — say why in the thread and let the reviewer press it or drop it. Not doing it quietly is not
an answer: it reads as agreement, and the same comment returns on the next review.
