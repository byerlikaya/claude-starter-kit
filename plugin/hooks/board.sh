#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Team board engine — a distributed claim lock and shared item memory for a team sharing one repository.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Every kit install is local: docs/PLAN.md and docs/SESSION_STATE.md are gitignored, so item #1 being taken
#   is invisible to everyone else and two people start the same work. This engine puts the item list, the
#   claims and the per-item handover notes on a git ref that the whole team pushes to.
#
# WHY A GIT REF IS THE LOCK (measured, not assumed)
#   `git push` to a ref is fast-forward-only unless forced. Two clones that build a claim commit on the SAME
#   base and push it: the first wins, the second is rejected non-fast-forward (exit 1) and must re-read the
#   board. That is an atomic compare-and-swap with zero infrastructure — no server, no token, no daemon.
#   Verified against a bare remote: loser exit=1, remote kept the winner's claim.
#
# WHY PLUMBING AND NOT A CHECKOUT
#   Commits are built with hash-object/read-tree/write-tree/commit-tree against a private index file. The
#   working tree, the index, the current branch and any stash are untouched — you can claim an item in the
#   middle of a feature branch with dirty files and nothing moves.
#
# NO NETWORK ON THE HOT PATH
#   Only claim/done/drop/sync/probe talk to the remote, because those are the operations whose whole point is
#   being atomic — reporting "you own it" without a confirmed push would be a lie. Session start and the
#   commit gate read a local cache / the local ref and never open a socket.
#
# PORTABILITY
#   No jq (Windows Git Bash has none). No `date -d` / `date -j` (GNU and BSD disagree) — timestamps are stored
#   as BOTH an ISO string for humans and an epoch integer for arithmetic, so nothing ever has to be re-parsed.
