#!/usr/bin/env bash
# verify.sh — run a CI gate locally, from the SAME definition CI runs.
#
# Why this exists. Every gate in this repo was reachable locally except as a set: the suites lived in
# eval/, the catalogue and manifest checks lived only in ci.yml, and "green" locally meant a strictly
# smaller thing than "green" in CI. That gap is not theoretical — a branch was pushed with all three
# eval suites green and CI failed on the one check that had no local runner, because the README
# catalogue is GENERATED and a hand-edited row silently drifts from the skill it describes.
#
# The fix is one definition, not two. ci.yml calls `verify.sh <step>` per step so GitHub still shows a
# named box per gate, and a developer calls `verify.sh` with no argument to run every step this machine
# can run. Writing the commands in both places is the anti-pattern the kit flags elsewhere: two copies
# of one rule drift, and the copy that drifts is always the one nobody runs.
#
#   bash packaging/verify.sh              # every step (cross steps included), stop at the first failure
#   bash packaging/verify.sh syntax       # one step by name
#   bash packaging/verify.sh --list       # the step names, in order
#
# Exit 0 only if every step attempted PASSED. A step whose tool is absent is reported SKIPPED and is
# NOT counted as a pass — the same rule the suites themselves follow, for the same reason: a check that
# did not run must never read like a check that succeeded.
#
# CREW_VERIFY_STRICT=1 turns a skip into a failure. CI sets it, because there a missing tool is a broken
# runner rather than an honest local limitation, and a gate that goes quiet on a broken runner is worse
# than no gate: it reports success for a check nobody performed.

# The gate must reach the same verdict whichever parser decoded the payload. This is a real step rather than a
# smoke section because it needs a SECOND parser to compare against, and a machine with only one has measured
# nothing — the script answers 3 for that, which is this file's skip, so the rc passes straight through with no
# translation: 0 every case agreed, 1 a divergence, 3 nothing compared. Under CREW_VERIFY_STRICT, which CI sets,
# that skip turns red, and it should: on a runner a missing parser is a broken runner.
#
# It is wired without `CREW_CONFORMANCE_KNOWN_OPEN`, deliberately. That variable exists to let the file land
# while its three findings were still open; all three are closed, so setting it here would mean a gate that
# cannot report the next one. The variable stays in the script and is pinned there to fail if a row it excuses
# starts passing — a safety valve that cleans itself up, not a permanent dispensation.

# The bilingual installer's message tables, audited statically: patterns quoted (an unquoted one is a GLOB, and
# a lot of prose ends in `?`), no colour or raw ESC inside a message, no stray backslash or bare `%` in a string
# that printf takes as its FORMAT, matching `%s` counts across languages, no `''` (bash concatenates it and eats
# the apostrophe, so `.NET''e` prints `.NETe` — valid syntax, silently wrong output), and no stale pattern that
# no longer matches anything in its script.
#
# Its own step rather than folded into `syntax`, because it has its own verdict to report and hiding it inside a
# step whose name says something else is how a gate stops being read. It is pure bash + awk deliberately: a
# python one would SKIP on a stock Windows desktop, where the Store's python3 stub resolves and then fails — the
# platform where the installer matters most, and the exact shape of four incidents this repo has already paid
# for. Whether gawk (Git Bash, ubuntu) and BSD awk (macOS) agree on it is not measurable on one machine, which
