# Reads a pull request's title and body on stdin and exits 1 when they carry an assistant's signature line: a
# tool's "generated" footer, a co-author trailer naming Claude or Anthropic, or a claude.ai/code link. Nothing in
# this repository is signed by a tool, in a commit, a PR description or a comment, and the rule has no exception.
# The patterns are written with [-] and [ ] so that this file's own lines do not trip the commit trace scan.
#
# ci.yml runs it on pull_request events and hands the text over through env, never through ${{ }} in the script,
# so what a description says is read as data and never run. It reads only the event payload; no request leaves.
# smoke-test.sh drives it on a fixture that must fail and on one that must pass.
