# Verify-by-contract — make the UI machine-checkable at runtime

Tests and typecheck are CI's job. **Verification is runtime observation at the surface:** you run the thing, drive
it, and read what it actually shows. Make that observation *structured and cheap* — so an agent (via the browser),
CI, and a human dashboard all read the **same truth through one code path** — instead of interpreting screenshots.

## 1 · The DOM is the machine-readable surface
Every component emits `data-verify-*` attributes describing its **state**, not its internals:
```html
<section data-verify-unit="TodoApp" data-verify-total="3" data-verify-done="1" data-verify-active="2">
```
Verifiers read the **contract**, never React/Vue internals — so you can rewrite internals freely as long as the
contract holds. A component with **no contract is a FAIL, not a warning**.

## 2 · Verifiable units: fixtures + invariants + a schema
Register each unit with: a props schema, named **fixtures** (a reproducible render config, with an optional
imperative `act()` to click/type/wait), and **invariants** (a predicate over the mounted DOM → `true` or a
human-readable violation).
- **Every unit needs ≥1 `probe` fixture** — an adversarial edge case (empty, huge, inconsistent). Enforce it: "you
  can't ship a unit that only tests the happy path."
- Keep **one fixture that is *designed to fail*** — it proves the framework catches lies, not just confirms truths.

## 3 · Isolated, deep-linkable render targets
`/verify/:unit/:fixture` mounts **only** that unit in a known state, no app shell (`?chrome=0` for a clean
screenshot). An agent navigates there, observes, reads the result — no scrolling the whole app.

## 4 · One agent handle, one verdict taxonomy
Expose `window.__verify`: `manifest()` (every unit × fixture × verifier), `current()` (structured result for what's
mounted), `runAll()` (the full matrix). The dashboard is just a human rendering of the same data; CI calls the same
runner.

Verdicts: **`PASS` · `FAIL` · `BLOCKED` · `SKIP`**; checks: `ok / fail / warn / probe`.
- **`BLOCKED` ("couldn't observe") is deliberately distinct from `FAIL` ("observed and wrong").**
- Rule: **when in doubt, FAIL** — a false PASS ships a bug; a false FAIL costs one more look.
- A verifier exception becomes a `fail` check with the stack as evidence — never swallowed.

## 5 · How the kit drives it
A frontend change is verified by driving the browser (the `claude-in-chrome` tools) to the isolated target and
calling `window.__verify.runAll()`, then reading the **structured verdicts** — closing the "did my change actually
work at runtime" loop without a human eyeballing pixels. This is the frontend counterpart to `iterate`'s external,
machine-grounded verifier and `eval-grader`'s scorecard.
