#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PARSER CONFORMANCE — the gate's payload reader must agree with a real JSON parser.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. guard-bash.sh read its payload through a ladder: jq, then python3, then a pure-bash
# slice. Three parsers meant three behaviours, and every parser incident this kit has had came from the tiers
# DIVERGING rather than from any one of them being weak:
#   * tier 3 was once `CMD="$INPUT"`, so every `git push` was hard-blocked as a force-push on any session id
#     containing `-f8`. CI never saw it, because CI has jq.
#   * Windows ships a python3 Store stub that satisfies `command -v` and cannot run, so stock desktops took
#     tier 2 and FAILED OPEN.
#   * a Windows-native jq writes stdout in TEXT mode, so tier 1 received `\` + CR + CR + LF where tier 3
#     received JSON's two-character escapes, and an ordinary commit was refused on one platform only.
# Each was found by a single assertion going red long after the change that caused it.
#
# TWO MODES, AND THE FILE CHOOSES BETWEEN THEM BY LOOKING AT THE HOOK.
#   LADDER PRESENT — the payload can still be read two ways, so the property is "both tiers reach the same
#     VERDICT". Exit codes are compared, not bytes: the tiers legitimately hand the rules different bytes and a
#     byte comparison would report those as defects and bury the one that is not.
#   LADDER ABSENT — there is only one reader in production, so a tier comparison would be the slice against
#     itself. The property becomes "the slice DECODES what a real parser decodes", measured against a reference
#     that never goes through the hook at all, plus "the gate still reaches the verdict each row declares".
# The DECODE check runs in BOTH modes on purpose. It costs nothing while the ladder is there and it means the
# normalisations below are already pinned by the time the ladder goes, rather than being written the same day
# they become the only thing standing.
#
# THE MODE DETECTOR IS ITSELF CALIBRATED, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. It is the one place where this whole file can go
# quiet: a detector that wrongly says "ladder absent" against a ladder-ful hook stops exercising tier selection
# and says nothing about it. So two fixtures are built and the detector must answer each correctly before any
# mode runs.
#
# THE DECODE RULES ARE TAKEN FROM THE HOOK'S CASE ARMS, NOT FROM A MEASUREMENT. Pinning whatever the slice
# happens to do today would make the pin agree with any future change. _json_unescape maps:
#     \n -> LF   \t -> TAB   \r -> DROPPED   \b and \f -> one space
#     \uXXXX matching 00[2-7][0-9a-fA-F] (printable ASCII) -> that character
#     any other \uXXXX -> a single `?`          \<anything else> -> that character literally
# A row whose expected decode is `=` must match the reference EXACTLY; a row that exercises one of those
# normalisations carries the literal it must produce, so each normalisation is a stated fact and not an excuse.
#
# FIXTURES ARE BYTE-CHECKED BEFORE THEY ARE TRUSTED. A corpus of escapes is the easiest thing in this repo to
# measure vacuously: write `\\u002e` and the payload carries an escaped BACKSLASH followed by the letters
# u002e — inert text every reader agrees about while proving nothing; write it through a shell that expands
# escapes and the payload carries a real `.` and no parser ever sees an escape. Both shapes happened while this
# corpus was being built, on two different machines. So every escape row declares the escape it needs, the
# payload's bytes are searched for it, and a row whose fixture came out inert is reported UNMEASURED, never as
# a pass. Every backslash in a fixture is produced at RUN TIME by printf rather than written literally here,
# because a literal one has to survive every layer between an author and this file and in this repo it has not.
#
# Exit 0 = everything agreed. Exit 1 = a divergence, a broken fixture, or a calibration that did not answer.
# Exit 3 = nothing could be compared on this machine (no hook, or no reference parser). Never a pass.

# AN EXIT CODE IS NOT A REASON. A row asserting rc=2 passes while the gate refuses for a rule that has nothing
# to do with the shape under test, and then keeps passing until the fixture changes. That happened here twice:
#   * a payload whose only `"command"` sat in a SIBLING object was read as "the refusal closed the hole" — the
#     slice had in fact read the sibling value and §4.5's `destructive rm -rf` fired on it. The harmless twin
#     (`ls -la` in the same place) returns 0, which is what makes the real behaviour visible: the gate judges a
#     string that is not the command that will run.
#   * every adversarial payload carried `"cwd":"/tmp"`, where no review record exists, so each row whose
#     command was a commit was refused by §4.6 before its own rule was ever reached.
# So: the payload's cwd is the prepared repo, each row may name the RULE it expects to fire, and the string the
# slice actually read is printed on every failure.
# EVERYTHING UP TO THE CLOSING PAREN, rather than a class of the characters a tag is expected to contain. A
# refusal protecting two sections is tagged `GUARD (§4.4/§4.5)`, and two narrower attempts both failed on it:
# `§[0-9.]+` stopped at the `/` and captured `GUARD (§4.4` with no closing paren, then `§[0-9./]+` stopped at
# the SECOND `§` and matched nothing at all, so the row reported "no rule fired" for a refusal that names two.
# Adding `§` to the class would also be fragile under `LC_ALL=C`, where it is two bytes. `[^)]*` has no opinion
