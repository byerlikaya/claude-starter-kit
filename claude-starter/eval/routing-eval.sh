# Behavioral eval: does a golden prompt route to the expected target via a trigger (deterministic)?
# Does NOT run Claude Code; it statically proxies the routing correctness of the trigger design:
#   1) Golden routing  — each example prompt must contain (as a substring) one trigger of its expected target.
#   2) Agent collision  — two DIFFERENT agents must not share the same trigger phrase (routing ambiguity).
# Turkish diacritics are normalized on both sides (guvenlik == güvenlik), so it is also robust for
# users who type without diacritics. In a pruned install, a line whose target is not installed is SKIPPED.
