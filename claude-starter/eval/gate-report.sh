# What did the gates actually DO? — reads CSK_GATE_LOG and reports it against the rule inventory.
#
# The kit's claim is that rules are enforced at the tool level rather than remembered. That claim is only worth
# what its evidence is worth, and until now the evidence was a green test suite: proof the gates CAN fire, never
# a record that they DID. This reads the other half.
#
# Two failure modes it is built around, both learned here the hard way:
#   1. "0 firings" and "never measured" leave identical artifacts. So a rule is reported as `not observed`, never
#      as dead, and a missing log is reported as NOT MEASURED — never as zero.
#   2. A hand-maintained rule list drifts from the rules. So the inventory is DERIVED from the installed hooks
#      on every run: a rule added to guard-bash.sh shows up here without anyone remembering to add it.
#
