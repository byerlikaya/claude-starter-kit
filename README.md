# 🛠️ Claude Starter Kit

**An agentic working kit for Claude Code** — a reusable scaffold that drives any project, at any stage, with the same engineering discipline.

*plan → build → review → commit, where every critical rule is a **gate**, not a reminder.*

## Why this kit?

Most "agent setups" are a pile of suggestions — the rules sit in a file, and whether they're honored is left to the model. This kit is different: it drops a **disciplined engineering team** into Claude Code, where **the rules that matter are gates, not reminders** — it doesn't just tell the agent the rules, it makes breaking the critical ones impossible, and it installs safely onto the repo you already have.

| | |
|---|---|
| 👥 | **A team, not a prompt** — 11 specialist agents auto-chain across plan → build → audit → ship; you don't wire them, the main thread does. |
| 🛡️ | **Security & privacy are gates, not options** — risk-critical changes must clear the security/privacy audit before they can close. |
| 🚦 | **Every commit is yours to approve** — no `commit`/`push` runs without your explicit OK, enforced at the tool level even in auto/bypass mode. |
| 🌿 | **Safe on an existing repo** — `adopt` hands the kit over on a branch; `main` is never touched, and you review before you keep it. |

## 🧠 The agents — the heart of the kit

**11 agents**, each a **thin trigger** — it says only *who* and *when*, and delegates the *how* to a skill. The main thread selects and chains them across **five stages**, escalating quality before anything is committed:

> Agent names carry a `-csk` suffix (Claude Starter Kit) so they never collide with the host project's own agents. Each agent is thin; the real method lives in a **skill** — the single source of truth.

---

## Three principles

1. **Agent = thin trigger.** An agent only says "who, when"; it stays short and leaves the "how" to a skill.
2. **Skill = single source of truth.** The actual method and rule live in the skill; they are not copied into the agent.
3. **Rule → gate.** The rule that matters is enforced at the tool level (hook · permission · eval). The model is not expected to remember it.

---

## Install & run

**Two entry points:** `start.sh` sets up a **fresh** project; **`adopt`** (`adopt.sh`) hands the kit over to an **existing** one. Pick any channel — each runs the same two commands.

**npx** — nothing to install:
```bash
npx @byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit          # fresh project
npx @byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit adopt    # existing project
npx @byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit@latest update   # refresh a project that already has the kit
```

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install byerlikaya/tap/claude-starter-kit
claude-starter-kit          # fresh project
claude-starter-kit adopt    # existing project
```

**Release tarball** — no package manager:
```bash
gh release download --repo byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit -p '*.tgz' && tar xzf claude-starter-kit-*.tgz
bash start.sh               # fresh project
bash adopt.sh              # existing project
```

> Just want the agents & skills inside your existing Claude Code (no scaffolding)? `/plugin marketplace add byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit` then `/plugin install claude-starter-kit@byerlikaya`.

> **Windows:** the kit is bash-based — run it inside **Git Bash** (from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)) for the smoothest experience; WSL works as a fallback.

### 🌱 Fresh project — `start.sh`

```bash
bash start.sh [--backend|--frontend|--mobile|--fullstack] [--dotnet|--generic] [-h]
```

An install wizard. With no flags it walks each step (profile → backend stack → summary and approval); the flags are for silent/CI use, and `-h` / `--help` prints usage. Every choice shows what it will install **before** installing it.

> After install, paste **`.claude/FIRST_PROMPT.md`** as your first Claude Code message — an optional kickoff that verifies the agents/skills and plans the first sprint. (`CLAUDE.md` loads the discipline every session regardless, so this is a one-time convenience, not a requirement.)

| Profile | Expert agents | Highlighted skills |
|---|---|---|
| `--backend` | backend · database | db-migration · api-design · observability |
| `--frontend` | frontend | frontend · a11y · i18n-integrity |
| `--mobile` | frontend (+ React Native/Expo layer) | frontend-rn-expo · a11y |
| `--fullstack` | all of them | all skills — backend **and** web **and** mobile (RN/Expo) |

There is no separate mobile agent: `frontend-expert-csk` covers web, mobile and desktop, and the mobile *how* lives in the `frontend-rn-expo` skill. `--fullstack` installs it too, so a fullstack project is ready for mobile without picking `--mobile`.

The backend stack is asked only for `--backend`/`--fullstack`: **`--dotnet`** brings the .NET / DevArchitecture pattern (MediatR CQRS · IResult · AOP) behind an approval gate; **`--generic`** installs the same expert without it — for Node, Go, Python, or a .NET project on a different pattern.

> **.NET — start proven, not from scratch.** `--dotnet` clones the production-ready **[DevArchitecture](https://github.com/DevArchitecture/DevArchitecture)** foundation (CQRS · IResult · AOP · auth) *and* installs agents that already know it — so you **skip the tokens an agent would burn regenerating a standard architecture**; they go to your business logic, not boilerplate. Opinionated by *default*, not by force: the backend expert applies your project's **pattern skill** — DevArchitecture out of the box, or your own (Clean Architecture, Vertical Slice, Minimal API, plain layered) dropped into `.claude/skills/`. `--generic` stays stack-agnostic.

> On **`--fullstack` + `--dotnet`** the DevArchitecture backend is placed in `./backend`, `./frontend` is reserved for your frontend, and the solution file is renamed to your project's name — so the project root stays clean instead of looking like a bare backend.

### 🔄 Existing project — `adopt.sh`

```bash
bash adopt.sh          # at the root of the target project
```

Applies the kit to a project already in motion, like **one team handing a project over to another** — the project is not broken, decisions already made are not lost, and the kit does not stay passive.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/handover-en.svg" alt="adopt.sh handover flow" width="900">
</div>

All changes land on a separate git branch **staged, not committed** — so every added and changed file shows up in your editor's Source Control / Changes panel; you review it there, then `git commit` to accept (or reset to discard). `main` stays untouched. Kit agents install side-by-side (never colliding), the discipline is bound via a single `@import`, `settings.json` is merged schema-aware, and existing husky/lefthook chains run alongside the kit via a shim. It closes with a durable `docs/HANDOVER.md` and an ADR, so decisions live in version control, not in a chat.

### 🔁 Update an installed project

```bash
npx @byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit@latest update    # `update` is an alias of `adopt`; run it at the project root
```

At install time the kit stamps `.claude/kit.conf` with the profile, the backend stack and which installer ran, plus `.claude/VERSION`. The updater reads that stamp and refreshes the project **in the shape it was installed in**: a `--backend` project does not get frontend agents grafted back on, and a `--dotnet` project keeps its `devarch-module` pattern skill. Where the stamp is absent, the updater derives the shape from the installed files and writes it. Compare `cat .claude/VERSION` against `npm view @byerlikaya/claude-starter-kit version` to see whether an update is waiting.

| | On update |
|---|---|
| `.claude/` agents · skills · commands · hooks · eval | refreshed from the new version |
| `.claude/DISCIPLINE.md` | **overwritten** — it is kit-owned, so keep nothing of your own in it |
| `./CLAUDE.md` | never touched — your project rules stay exactly as you wrote them |
| `.claude/settings.json` | merged schema-aware; your own hooks and permissions survive |
| your own agents and skills (no `-csk` suffix) | untouched |

Like `adopt`, an update needs a git repo and lands on a `kit-adopt-<timestamp>` branch, staged and uncommitted — review the diff, then commit to accept or reset to discard.

> If a project's `CLAUDE.md` carries the discipline **inline** instead of importing it, discipline updates cannot reach that project. The updater detects this, shows which lines hold the inline block, and offers to replace them with the single `@.claude/DISCIPLINE.md` import — writing a backup first, on a branch you review. Decline and nothing is touched; your project section and your own rules survive either way.

## Session & token management

An assistant cannot run `/context` itself, so most setups **guess** the session fill. This kit measures it. `context-usage.sh` reads the real token count from the last turn's API usage in the transcript — the same figure `/context` shows. The `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects it every turn; the `Stop` hook (`session-guard.sh`) warns you the first time fill crosses **75%**, and once more at **90%** — one warning per threshold, and it never blocks your turn. The session-health line rests on a measurement, not a guess.

### Token cost

`DISCIPLINE.md` and the agent/skill descriptions load into every session's context. That always-on material measured **9,198 tokens** on a real turn for 11 agents and 28 skills; `brainstorm` and `reflect` add ~660 bytes (≈ 280 tokens) on top — the price of the whole discipline layer.

`smoke-test.sh` enforces a byte budget per component (discipline · agent descriptions · skill descriptions), so the cost cannot drift upward unnoticed. A budget can be raised, but only by editing `smoke-test.sh` explicitly.

> **Profile pruning does not save tokens.** A `--backend` install (10 agents, 27 skills) costs only ~640 tokens less than `--fullstack` (11 agents, 30 skills). Pick a profile to narrow the scope of the work.

---

## Rule → gate

| Rule | Enforcing mechanism |
|---|---|
| Commit/push only with approval — in every permission mode | `guard-bash.sh` (PreToolUse) raises an approval prompt only you can answer; approve once and Claude runs the commit. Fails closed under `bypassPermissions`; `CLAUDE_GIT_OK=1` pre-authorises headless runs |
| Destructive op (reset --hard · force push · rm -rf · --no-verify) | `guard-bash.sh` (blocked at the tool level) |
| No AI-authorship trace or external vendor name in a commit | `pre-commit` + `commit-msg` git hook — scans your project's files; the kit's own `.claude/` tree is exempt (it names the tool it configures), secrets never are |
| No API key / token / private key committed | `pre-commit` secret scan (`secret-blocklist.txt` + `.secret-allowlist.txt`) |
| Session threshold | `context-usage.sh` + `session-guard.sh` (Stop hook) |
| Always-on context stays lean | `smoke-test.sh` byte budgets per component (discipline · agent descriptions · skill descriptions) |
| A running session never follows stale rules | `context-usage.sh` compares `.claude/VERSION` against the version the session started with, and says so |
| Quality gate (SonarQube projects — language-agnostic) | `sonarqube-check` + `/ship` |

The gates are armed via `settings.json` and git `core.hooksPath`; `smoke-test.sh` verifies they are ready after every change.

---

## Verification

```bash
bash .claude/eval/smoke-test.sh      # structure, frontmatter, gate integrity
bash .claude/eval/routing-eval.sh    # does an example prompt route to the right agent/skill
```

## Workflow

`/plan` (ambiguous scope) → expert agents build → `/review` (security · quality · test) → `/ship` (DoD gate; proposes the commit, waits for approval) → when context fills up, `/handoff` → `/clear`.

## Extending

When you add an agent or skill, follow the `AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` contract: frontmatter (name · description + Trigger phrases · least-privilege tools · model tier) and body (When → Expertise stance → How/skill → Coordination → DoD → Output & context → Errors/escalation → Example → Constraints).
